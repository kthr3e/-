1.
SELECT student_name,birthday FROM student_tbl WHERE MONTH(birthday) = DATE_FORMAT(NOW(),'%Y%m')
閏年の計算は？
毎月使えるような設計

2.
INSERT INTO student_tbl(student_name,email,tel,birthday,join_date,school_year,school_name) VALUES ('大島直子','oshima@example.com',08012121212,'2008-01-29','2020-11-28',1,'あいう中学校')
INSERT INTO course_tbl VALUES(45,2)
INSERT INTO course_tbl VALUES(45,3)

3.
SELECT student_name FROM student_tbl WHERE student_tbl.student_id IN ( SELECT student_id FROM course_tbl
WHERE item_id = 2 ) AND school_year = 2 AND school_name ='いろは中学校'
数学にした方が使い勝手がいいかも
問題文を読み直す

4.
電話番号がint型なのでchar型にして先頭の０が入るようにする

5.
DELETE FROM student_tbl WHERE school_year=3
UPDATE school_year SET
  school_year=
    CASE
      WHEN 2 THEN 3
      ELSE 2

三年生の処理をうまくする

6.
INSERT INTO item_tbl VALUES(4,'プログラミング')
INSERT INTO teacher_tbl VALUES('永島 紬','hlpifna_aorejk@mlfq.neth',2345678901,2)

数学とプログラミング両方担当

7.
SELECT count(*)*5000 as '今月の売り上げ' FROM `course_tbl`

8.
SELECT student_tbl.student_name, 5000*count as '今月の支払い'
FROM student_tbl,(SELECT student_id,COUNT(*) as 'count' FROM course_tbl GROUP by student_id) as count
WHERE student_tbl.student_id = count.student_id

9.

GROUP BY id_year.school_year

10.
SELECT id_year.student_name

  AND id_year.student_id IN (
    SELECT student_id

11.

GROUP BY id_year.school_year


12.
SELECT school_year,student_name,sum(score) as '合計得点'
FROM (SELECT student_id,school_year,student_name FROM student_tbl ORDER BY school_year) as id_year,
(SELECT student_id,score FROM test_score_tbl WHERE test_id=1) as student_score
WHERE id_year.student_id = student_score.student_id
GROUP BY id_year.student_id
ORDER BY id_year.school_year,`合計得点` DESC
受けた科目数によって表示する順位を分けてみてもいいかも

13.
退会者を示すremove_flagと退会理由を導入
0のときは学習塾に在籍（復帰も含む）
１の時に退会している
ex) id = 1 の人が退会した時
UPDATE student_tbl
SET remove_flag='1',reason='料金が高い'
WHERE id = 1

14.
SELECT student_name
FROM student_tbl,
(SELECT school_year,AVG(score)　as a
FROM (SELECT student_id,school_year FROM student_tbl ORDER BY school_year) as id_year,
(SELECT student_id,score FROM test_score_tbl WHERE test_id=1 AND item_id = 2) as student_score
WHERE id_year.student_id = student_score.student_id
GROUP BY id_year.school_year) as mean,

(SELECT school_year,student_score.student_id,score
 FROM (SELECT student_id,school_year FROM student_tbl ORDER BY school_year) as id_year,
 			(SELECT student_id,score FROM test_score_tbl WHERE test_id=1 AND item_id = 2) as student_score
 			WHERE id_year.student_id = student_score.student_id ORDER BY school_year) as score

WHERE mean.school_year = score.school_year AND mean.a <= score.student_score
